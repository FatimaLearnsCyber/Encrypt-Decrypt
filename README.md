𝐀𝐄𝐒 𝐄𝐧𝐜𝐫𝐲𝐩𝐭/𝐃𝐞𝐜𝐫𝐲𝐩𝐭 𝐀𝐩𝐩𝐥𝐢𝐜𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧

This Python application allows you to 𝐞𝐧𝐜𝐫𝐲𝐩𝐭 𝐚𝐧𝐝 𝐝𝐞𝐜𝐫𝐲𝐩𝐭 𝐦𝐞𝐬𝐬𝐚𝐠𝐞𝐬 using the 𝐀𝐄𝐒 (𝐀𝐝𝐯𝐚𝐧𝐜𝐞𝐝 𝐄𝐧𝐜𝐫𝐲𝐩𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧 𝐒𝐭𝐚𝐧𝐝𝐚𝐫𝐝) algorithm. It features a user-friendly GUI, built with the Tkinter library, allowing users to easily encrypt and decrypt data by simply providing a secret key and the message. The app uses the AES algorithm in CBC mode with padding to encrypt and decrypt messages securely, and the encrypted message and initialization vector (IV) are encoded in Base64 for easy handling. To install, clone the repository with git clone https://github.com/FatimaLearnsCyber/Encrypt-Decrypt.git, navigate to the project directory with cd Encrypt-Decrypt, and install the required Python packages by running pip install -r requirements.txt. To run the application, execute the Python script python encrypt_decrypt_gui.py, which will open the GUI where you can enter the secret key and message. The secret key must be exactly 16 characters long, and you can type the message you wish to encrypt or decrypt. Press the "Encrypt" button to encrypt the message, and the result will appear in the result area. To decrypt, enter the IV and ciphertext (formatted as iv:ciphertext) into the message field and press the "Decrypt" button. The decrypted message will appear in the result area. For example, with a secret key mysecretkey1234 and message Hello, World!, the result would be the encrypted message. To decrypt, use the same secret key and the encrypted message to get back Hello, World!. If you wish to contribute, fork the repository, make changes, and create a pull request.
